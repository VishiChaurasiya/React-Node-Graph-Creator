# React Graph Editor with ReactFlow

This is a web application built using ReactJS and ReactFlow library that allows users to create, update and delete nodes and branches in a graph. The application features an intuitive user interface with dynamic updates for real-time editing.

## Features

- Create new nodes by clicking the "Create node" button on the left side of the screen. The new node will appear as a circle or rectangle shape in the main panel.
- Connect two nodes by clicking on one node and dragging the mouse to the other node. A new branch will appear between the two nodes.
- Hover over a node to display an "X" icon in red color. Clicking on the icon will delete the node and all its associated branches.
